    "## Generalized coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct application of Newton's laws to mechanical systems results in a set of equations of motion in terms of Cartesian coordinates of each of the particles that make up the system. In many cases, this is not the most convenient coordinate system to solve the problem or describe the movement of the system. For example, in problems involving many particles, it may be convenient to choose a system that includes the coordinate of the center of mass. Another example is a serial chain of rigid links, such as a member of the human body or from a robot manipulator, it may be simpler to describe the positions of each link by the angles between links.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Coordinate systems such as these are referred as [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates). Generalized coordinates uniquely specify the positions of the particles in a system. Although there may be several generalized coordinates to describe a system, usually a judicious choice of generalized coordinates provides the minimum number of independent coordinates that define the configuration of a system (which is the number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)\">degrees of freedom</a> of the system), turning the problem simpler to solve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Being a little more technical, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics)):  \n",
    "\"In classical mechanics, the parameters that define the configuration of a system are called generalized coordinates, and the vector space defined by these coordinates is called the configuration space of the physical system. It is often the case that these parameters satisfy mathematical constraints, such that the set of actual configurations of the system is a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates. This manifold is called the configuration manifold of the system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In problems where it is desired to use generalized coordinates, one can write Newton's equations of motion in terms of Cartesian coordinates and then transform them into generalized coordinates. However, it would be desirable and convenient to have a general method that would directly establish the equations of motion in terms of a set of convenient generalized coordinates. In addition, general methods for writing, and perhaps solving, the equations of motion in terms of any coordinate system would also be desirable. The [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) is such a method.\n",
